# MakeOverForAll
 Automation for MakeOver website 
 
 Hi yall! its me BananaHammock!
 
 So I made this automation test for an Interview I got at a cool design company and would like to showcase it you guys.
 Hope you all like it!
 
 Anyway, what you will need to run this code will be explained below:
 - understanding of Java 6 and up (duh, lol)
 - you can run this preferably on IntelliJ IDEA
 - When you first download and open it, dont forget to reload all the Maven dependencies in the pom.xml file
 - I havent made it so you can run on Terminal, but you can still Run in on the Test Files. just go to Java Class that has 'Tests' behind it and run it from there
 - Cheers! and Have fun!
